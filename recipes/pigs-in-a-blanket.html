    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pigs in a blanket are perfect for parties — and they quickly come together with just three ingredients!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Biscuit dough: This easy recipe starts with a 10-ounce package of refrigerated biscuit dough.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Sliced American cheese is an optional ingredient, but we recommend it.</li>
        <li>Frankfurters: If you can’t find authentic frankfurters, any hot dog will do. For a bite-sized version, use cocktail sausages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Shape the dough into circles.</li>
        <li>Lay a slice of cheese on each circle, place a frankfurter on each slice, and roll it up.</li>
        <li>Place rolls, seam-side down, on a cookie sheet and bake until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
